Welcome to Flood Check's documentation!
===================================

**Flood Check** gives you real-time updates on stream, rainfall, and tide conditions to help you understand local flood risk at a glance.

Our goal is to make flood data simple, clear, and useful for everyday decisions — whether you’re commuting, protecting your home, or planning outdoor activities.

**Key Features**
| **Real-time stream levels** -  instantly see if your local waterways are at flood stage.
| **Rainfall tracking** - monitor the  precipitation severity along the coast and in higher elevations
| **Tide conditions** – view current tide severity and its potential effects.
| **Easy-to-read dashboard** – complex flood data simplified into user-friendly graphics.
| **Community-focused design** – created to help communities at risk stay informed and prepared.

With **Flood Check**, you’ll know the conditions before you go — giving you peace of mind and the tools to make safe, informed decisions.
